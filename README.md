  ## Usage
To get started, navigate to the deployed application link. You can browse through different user's profiles and view all the items they have for sale with a title, price, and description of the item. If you'd like to list an item for sale, you'll have to create an account by pressing the `SIGN UP` button in the navbar. Once your account is created, press the `VIEW MY SELLER PROFILE` button, you will then be presented with a form to add a product. Once the product has been created you will see that the product name is present on your profile, click the product if you want to see more information or press the `X` to delete it. You will only be able to update your own product if you are the logged in user, if not you will be met with an INTENTIONAL error.
